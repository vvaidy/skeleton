Skeleton
==============

This repository contains Vijay's customized version of the Skeleton theme [“Skeleton”](http://drupal.org/project/skeletontheme) Drupal theme. I am not planning to try to stay compatible with the original version because I dont know enough CSS etc. There are my hacks and they work for me. I've also integrated some ideas from Luke Steven's D2 site: http://design2-0.com (with his kind consent!)

To avoid name clashes, I've called this *skl8*, pronounced like escalate

Note that this is just the theme files ... I've removed all the stuff to do with setting up a sample drupal installation, whcih I assume you already have running. ...

You are welcome however to grab this code and do whatever you like with it, at your own risk.
